# Systems-Fundamentals-Terminal
This project is a simple Unix shell implementation for my Systems Fundamentals class. The shell supports basic functionality such as changing directories and executing system programs (e.g., pwd and ls). The goal of the project is to deepen my understanding of system-level programming by working with process control, environment variables, and memory management.
